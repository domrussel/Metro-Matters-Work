README

The funciton get_zips_for_csv takes a csv that includes latitude and longitude data and uses the google maps reverse geocoder to add an additional zipcode row based on the lat and long.
It was originally used to convert HUD data files on subsidized low-income housing that included lat and long, to zip codes for mapping purposes.
